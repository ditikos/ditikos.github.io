This is five years in the future. I am still alive, along the whole madness that is now cumulated to the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot have changed. When I started this mini static blog eveything was related to projects that I was supposed to work on as a freelance develper / MSc holder.

Five years later, all of these projects were duds, learned new techniques and got into the corporate world as a developer in the gaming industry.
